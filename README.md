## üîç The Problem

After working in customer service for 10 years, including at a dental clinic, I witnessed firsthand the inefficiencies of paper-based patient management systems:

**For Patients:**
- Uncomfortable filling out lengthy forms in waiting rooms under time pressure
- No way to track appointments or update personal information
- Forms could be lost or damaged

**For Clinic Staff:**
- Difficulty reading handwritten patient information
- Time-consuming manual data entry and retrieval
- Risk of losing important patient documents
- No centralized system for appointment management

These pain points inspired me to create a digital solution that improves the experience for both patients and healthcare providers.

## ‚úÖ The Solution

**DentaHub** is a modern web application that streamlines the entire patient journey - from registration to appointment management. 

Patients can:
- Complete registration forms at their own pace from any device
- View and manage their appointments in real-time
- Update personal information without clinic visits
- Get instant answers to common dental questions via AI chatbot

Meanwhile, clinic administrators can:
- Manage all appointments from a centralized dashboard
- Confirm or cancel appointments with automated SMS notifications
- Track appointment statistics (scheduled, pending, cancelled)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimers**

**Admin Passkey Exposure**
The admin passkey is intentionally exposed for demonstration purposes only. In a production environment passkeys would never be exposed in code or documentation.

**Privacy & Compliance**
This application demonstrates technical capabilities but is not GDPR-compliant in its current state. For real-world medical use in the EU, additional features would be required:
- GDPR-compliant data encryption and audit logging
- Data subject rights implementation (access, erasure, portability)
- Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)
- Data Processing Agreements with third-party services
- Patient consent management and data retention policies

While Appwrite offers compliance features, each EU member state may have additional healthcare data regulations that must be addressed.

**Data Security**
- All sensitive data is encrypted by Appwrite
- Files are stored securely with access control
- Authentication tokens are httpOnly cookies
- Environment variables protect API keys
